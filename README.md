## Input file

The input file should have the following data. Required fields are bold.

| **Field Name** | **Format** | **Description** |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Date** | `MM/dd/yyyy` | One row per date for each day between the start and end of school |
| **School is Open** | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | `TRUE` if school is open |
| **Is Special Day** | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | `FALSE` if this is a regular day of the rotation. If `School is Open` is `FALSE`, this **must** be `TRUE`. |
| **Day Number** | Integer from `1` to `7` | The day of the rotation. These are provided by the division, however, they can be generated by an Excel formula. That is included below. |
| **Description 1** | String | If this date is a holiday or there is a special event, such Community Day or Thanksgiving Break, provide that here. A value is not required. |
| **Description 2** | String | Provide an additional description here. A value is not required. |
| Description _n_ | String | You can have as many of these as you need. |

This information is provided by the US Registrar or Grade Dean, and reviewed by the MS. They provide a calendar with the rotation on it. Use it to fill in the spreadsheet from the [XLSX template][xlsx_template] file. Start the first row with a `0` so that your formula will work properly.

Use this Excel formula to automatically fill in the `Day Number` field:

```
=IF($D3, $E2, IF($E2 = 7, 1, $E2 + 1))
```
